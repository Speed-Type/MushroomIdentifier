## The Algorithm

The model is retrained from the resnet-18 model, using a dataset of over 5000 images. The python file utilizes the .onnx file to recognize an image that the user inputs. A few test images are also included.

This mushroom genuses this model can detect are:
* Agaricus
* Amanita
* Boletus
* Cortinarius
* Entoloma
* Hygrocybe
* Russula
* Sullius
* Lactarius
